The last week or so I've found myself enthralled with a protocol that was before my time: Usenet.

Usenet had it's start in the very beginnings of the internet - It started out on ARPANET and was around until what seems to be the early 2000s. I'm not here to write a history of it (you can find a recent, well-written one [here](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/blog/2019-11/2019-11-14a.html)), but I do want to write some of my thoughts and experiences as I played with it recently.

I had played with usenet/nntp before,
